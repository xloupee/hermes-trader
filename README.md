# Pump.fun Migration Telegram Bot

Telegram notifier for Pump.fun coin migrations using PumpPortal's realtime websocket.

## What the bot listens to

PumpPortal's Data API exposes a websocket at:

```text
wss://pumpportal.fun/api/data?api-key=your-api-key-here
```

After connecting, this bot sends:

```json
{ "method": "subscribeMigration" }
```

The docs list `subscribeMigration` as free, and warn to use only one websocket connection at a time.

## Setup

1. Create a Telegram bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), then copy the bot token.
2. Copy the example env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Fill in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. Set `TELEGRAM_VERIFY_CODE` to a private invite code people must send before receiving alerts. `PUMPPORTAL_API_KEY` is optional for migrations, but supported if you have one.
4. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

6. In Telegram, open your bot and send `/start`.
7. Send `/verify your-code` using the value from `TELEGRAM_VERIFY_CODE`.
8. Restart the bot so automatic migration alerts can be sent to verified chats:

```bash
npm start
```

Verified subscribers are stored in `TELEGRAM_SUBSCRIBERS_PATH`. `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is optional, but when present it is treated as the admin chat that can change alert mode.

## Bot commands

- `/start` - Start notifications.
- `/verify <code>` - Verify this chat for notifications.
- `/stop` - Stop notifications for this chat.
- `/help` - Show the command list.
- `/migrations` - Watch migrated coins only.
- `/newtokens` - Watch newly created tokens only.
- `/both` - Watch new tokens and migrated coins.

## Notes

- Keep only one running instance of this bot per PumpPortal API key.
- If PumpPortal sends a new migration payload shape, the bot still sends a notification with the raw event JSON.
- Telegram messages are HTML escaped before sending.
- To inspect recent on-chain migrations without waiting for a live event, run `npm run past-migrations -- 10`.
- Set `SOLANA_RPC_URL` in `.env` if public Solana RPC rate limits you.
